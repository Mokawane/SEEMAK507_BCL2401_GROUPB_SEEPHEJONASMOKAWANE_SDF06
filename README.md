- **Responsive Design**: I implemented media queries to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to apply styling elements in all required sections to provide a similar Instagram profile.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Adjusting layouts and font sizes for smaller screens was challenging. I had to conduct a research on different sites to enhance my understanding in such category to ensure that the design remained consistent and functional.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Implementing interactive elements like hover and focus effects required more practice and research to get them right, and i could not get them 100% but i am confident enough that as my learning improves i will master them. 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to explore more advanced CSS properties and animations to enhance the user experience. 
- **Code Optimization**:  While my code achieved the desired outcome, I believe that my commitment and dedication in learning website development and the end of the term i will be able to master all the requirements that will be subjected to me.
